I may use some of these slick commands or shortcuts without explanation.


-- !$ means the last word in command history.
   google "bash special variables command history"
   
--  How do you ssh and scp without passwords?  Aliases for servers?

    Google ssh-keygen or  "rsa keys" or  ".ssh/config" ...

-- Changing directories?
   	    cd -     ## change to previous dir
      	    pushd and popd:  creates a "stack" of directories.
	    google "linux pushd"
